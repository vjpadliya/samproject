TRANSFORMATIONS DONE ON ORIGINAL DATA SET TO ARRIVE AT TIDY DATA SET
========================================================================

1. subjectid and activity_label are appended in that order as beginning columns to test dataset
2. subjectid and activity_label are appended in that order as beginning columns to train dataset
3. The train and test datasets from step1 and step2 are combined rowwise (train followed by test) to form a single dataset.
4. From resultant data set of step3, a subset is extracted with following columns in the order
	a. subjectid
	b. activity_label
	c. All columns (66) depicting mean and standard deviation for each of the feature measurement. For this purpose strings "mean()" and "std()" are searched in the feature names in the file "features.txt".
5. In data subset from step4, activity_label is replaced by descriptive activity names detailed in "activity_labels.txt" file. List of activity labels is given below.
6. In dataset from step5, descriptive column names are added. List of column names is given below
7. From dataset in step6, a tidy data set is created with average of each variable for each subjectid and each activity.
8. The tidy data set from step7 is written to file "tidydataset.txt". Each row of of file represents a unique combination of subjectid and activity and depicts the average value for 66 features.


=======================
ACTIVITY LABELS
=======================
The 6 activity labels are - 
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING


=======================
COLUMN NAMES
=======================
First and second columns (variables) in the data set are subjectid and activity in that order.
These are followed by the 66 features used in the subset in order.
